# Linked List
This is my implementation of a linked list in the Ruby language.

This was made as part of the Odin Projects Full Stack Curriculum. 

The assignment was not so easy but it clicked in my head after a while. 
After that the remaining functions were quiet easy to implement. :)

Check it out at [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/linked-lists) !

Run it from the main directory.
```
ruby lib/linked_list
```
