# Linked List
This is my implementation of a linked list in the Ruby language

This was made as part of the Odin Projects Full Stack Curriculum

Check it out at [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/linked-lists) !

Run it from the main directory.
```
ruby lib/linked_list
```
